Being that we're in Java this is still a little safer that what we'd be doing because our errors would be caught at compile time. That being said dealing with Generics can be very confusing and we typically need to be very specific when dealing with them. Our methods and classes will typically have to jump through a lot more hoops to make it useable by multiple other types.\n",
