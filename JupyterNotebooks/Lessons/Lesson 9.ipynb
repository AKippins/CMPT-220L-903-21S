    "## Improving Problem Solving [(Example for class)](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/list-comprehensions/problem)\n",
    "---\n",
    "This section is something that typically isn't taught in a CS course and is more of a personal thought to include. That being said this isn't what has to be done and may not work in all scenarios. This is more a note to the piece of CS that isn't typically talked about but has a place in every conversation regarding computing, tech, and the world in general. We need a method to solve problems. We all don't attack problems the same but the following is how I typically approach issues. \n",
    "\n",
    "### I have a problem and I've read through it\n",
    "---\n",
    "At this point I either understand the question fully, I have some idea of what we're doing, I'm clueless, or I'm reading the question again because I undestood nothing the first time and it's because of my inability to read and not because I can't solve the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### When we get a problem we need to understand what we're doing.\n",
    "So I have a conundrum, I don't understand the problem. Do i understand parts of the problem? Am I close to understanding it and am just missing a couple pieces? Have I done something like this before that I can equate this too? How can I get myself to the point where I understand what this is trying to tell me? \n",
    "\n",
    "### Break the problem down.\n",
    "Let's start by finding the seams in the problem. That way we can break the problem down into smaller problems. Often we'll find that complex things are made up of a bunch of smaller complex things. All this to say it's hard to see an elephant for what it is standing 3 inches away from the elephant. We need to step back and see the elephant or in the case of this bad metaphor our problem for what it is. A bunch of smaller problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### We get more managable pieces, then figure out what each part needs to do. \n",
    "Now we have more managable pieces. We can start figuring out how to tend to all of the smaller pieces. The cycle may restart here if one of the pieces is still complex but you're now closer to solving the issue that you're having. You have this smaller hurdle to jump over than you did before. \n",
    "\n",
    "We're gonna continue as if our pieces are all small enough though. We've got managable pieces. We know what they're each responsible for. Now it's time to start building these things out.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Get it into terms we can understand\n",
    "Ok so we have our \"managable\" piece. Sometimes you're doing something that you're weak in or just can't seem to understand a topic. Sometimes you just need to get it related to something that you do understand. \n",
    "\n",
    "Both an artist and a mathematition can draw a square. They care about different things but generally they both know. what a square is. Most of the time you to start just need to generally understand what you need to do. So if you're the mathematition or the artist trying to understand something in the other realm the fine details can come later as long as you can get a general understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scale down\n",
    "This part is probably my favorite and most comforting step. My problem seems insurmountable. I don't know how I could ever do it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's scale it down. I need to find out if 47,055,833,459 is a prime number. *cough cough* ~This is your assignment (sorta)~ That number is ridiculous. Let's start with a number I know is prime like 2 or 5 or 7. I'm going to find out if these smaller numbers are prime and ignore the big number for now. \n",
    "\n",
    "With this we can learn a valuable lesson. We're looking inbetween the lines. We need something that discovers prime numbers. Not large prime numbers. Just prime numbers. I say this to demonstrate that we need to look at the simple case for this. The big number is there to scare you. You need to focus on the process and the solution. If your process is sound the size of the problem becomes less of an issue. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Car example](https://hackernoon.com/hn-images/1*1L6_1aPP-_kFDAfbt9DkUQ.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Find a solution\n",
    "Ok I've scaled my issue down. I'm going to find out if numbers from 1-10 are prime or composite. Now I can start implementing a solution. This part is super important to think about. How is this done now. Has anyone done this or something like it? \n",
    "\n",
    "Now we don't want to take answers but we know how to determine if a number is prime or not. Now we need to abstract that solution so that I can give it any number. Meaning that my solution has to be dynamic. I can't have hard coded numbers in there. We also need to handle edge cases. Is 1 a prime number? (No.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scale up\n",
    "Now that we have our solution and we've tested it on the small scale level, it's time to attack our big scary number. \n",
    "\n",
    "47,055,833,459\n",
    "\n",
    "We may be successful here. We may have to scale back down and tweak our solution with a bigger test range. What's important is that we've made a lot of progress. Time to tinker till we get it right.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fix edge cases (Sometimes)\n",
    "Even when our code is right and working sometimes we have edge cases that we didn't account for. \n",
    "\n",
    "Did you test negative numbers? \n",
    "\n",
    "Did you test 0? \n",
    "\n",
    "Edge/Fringe cases will always exist so don't feel too bad if you don't get them all on the first pass. "

    "## Revisiting Binary Tree\n",
    "Trees are the data type that we're going to be focused on in our project so we'll take these little refreshers here and there.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dynamically Adding Elements\n",
    "By now you've probably realized that you'll need to dynamically add objects. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now what does entail? We need to first see if our BST has a root node. If it doesn't, our inital element goes there. Otherwise we need to look at the value of the root node and the element that we're trying to add. If it's less than our number then it gets stored in our left child, if it's a duplicate we've decided to use the left child, and if it's greater than our number then right child. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can't make all of these decisions manually. You never know who will come along and decide to use your BST class. You may have to store some information for use later. Your code will need to be able to decide where to put these new values. \n",
    "\n",
    "To do this dynamically we need to think about what the tree needs to keep track of and program in that logic. While this is happening be sure to think not only about the requirements but possible people trying to break you.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Finding Elements\n",
    "Finding elements in our tree is fairly simple. "

    "## Advanced Java Concepts\n",
    "Now that we've been using Java for a little while we should learn some more important terminology. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Abstraction\n",
    "Here we're more so focused on the blueprints of what we're going to be working on rather then the physical implementation of the blueprints.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're looking to hide the actual implementation of what will be available to the end user and only give them the functionality of the object. So in terms of where we've seen this are Abstract Classes and Inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Abstract Classes\n",
    "Abstract classes have the `abstract` keyword in the declaration of the class. \n",
    "\n",
    "These are capable of having `abstract` methods along side our regular methods. These are methods with no body. Meaning they're just empty. They are empty because we can extend them later and define the methods then. If we're using `abstract` methods then the class must be `abstract`. They also don't have curly braces `{}` we just cap it off with a semicolon.\n",
    "\n",
    "When classes are `abstract` they can't be instantiated meaning we can't make an instance of our abstract class with our normal `Object variableName = new Object();`\n",
    "\n",
    "To use these classes we need to `extend` the abstract class when making a new class. When we `extend` our abstract class we need to make sure that we provide actual implementations of the methods that we've given in the `abstract` class because remember we didn't define them before. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Interfaces\n",
    "Interfaces are similar to abstract classes but taken a step further in levels of abstraction. So first we're implicitly abstract and don't need to declare it. That being said being abstract in totality, we can ONLY use abstract methods in an interface. It'll have no body. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Same as the abstract class we can't instantiate from our interface. \n",
    "- Unlike regular classes we don't have a constructor. \n",
    "- It's irregular to have variables here but we can do so if they're `static` or `final`\n",
    "    - `static` these can be accessed without making an instance of the class\n",
    "    - `final` these cannot be changed after initialized\n",
    "- Instead of being extended interfaces are `implemented`\n",
    "- Interfaces can `extend` multiple interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inheritance\n",
    "We've seen inheritance for our classes already and now it time to learn a little more about it. So you've seen me use `extends` when we did the `Mammal` example. This is when we subclass things, extend things, implement things. We inherit things from the class that were pulling from. We inherit the methods and variable of said class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Polymorphism\n",
    "Polymorphism is implicit in Java. We have something called an IS-A relationship. This is basically the same as our `Mammal` example for instance we have a `Human` class. That `extends` `Mammal` we can also say that `Human` IS-A `Mammal`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism is the ability to take on multiple forms through `implements` and `extends`. \n",
    "\n",
    "All Java objects are polymorphic because they will pass the IS-A test with themselves and the `Object` class. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Encapsulation\n",
    "Finally we have encapsulation. This is the ability to wrap all of the data and methods to manipulate that data belonging to a class together as a single unit. \n",
    "\n",
    "We're already partially there with the classes that we've been making. To have full encapsulation we need to \n",
    "- Declare our variables `private`\n",
    "- Provide public setter and getter methods that will access and allow you to view those private variable values"

    "## Managing Java Classes\n",
    "When it comes to managing Java classes there are somethings that we can do to make our lives a little easier when it comes to being formulaic about things. For now we're going to talk about constructor and getters and setters. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Constructor\n",
    "We've already seen constructors in action. They're responsible for setting up our classes when we make a new instance of it. This is where we handle our logic as it pertains to things being defined with our initial objects. If things are subclassed then we need to access the `super` method by doing this we can pass along the parameters that belong to the class that we're extending. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Getters and Setters\n",
    "Having getters and setters is a simple concept in my opinion. \n",
    "\n",
    "Getters are a way to access the data inside of our object through a method. \n",
    "Setters are a way to set the data inside our object. \n",
    "\n",
    "These are important because they allow us access values when we make things private."

    "Something that we'll be doing for the next couple of weeks is looking at a few sorting algorithms. We're going to do this to improve our ability to interpret and understand logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bubble Sort\n",
    "Bubble sort is the easiest implementation of sorting that we could probably implement. \n",
    "\n",
    "Logically the way it works is by swapping elements if they're not in the right order.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic way to know that your done is by passing over the list and there being no swaps that happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Example](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bubble-sort/)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Selection Sort\n",
    "Selection sort is also fairly easy to implement. \n",
    "\n",
    "This works by finding the smallest element in the array on each pass. Once we do that we then look at the subarray minus the element that we sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "We know that were done when our sub array gets down to 0. \n",
    "\n",
    "[Example](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/selection-sort/)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Insertion Sort\n",
    "Insertion sort is one of the more natural ones of the sorting methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "This works similar to people sorting things into piles. Think cards! If you've been dealt cards usually you have a sorted portion and an unsorted portion and you'll insert cards into the proper place. For this we traverse the list from left to right and look at the current element if the current element is less than the one before it we move it to the left until it's in the proper place.\n",
    "\n",
    "We know we're done when we reach the end of the list. \n",
