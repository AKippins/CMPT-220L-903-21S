    "# Loops\n",
    "Loops run in a similar way to what we've seen so far. Syntax changes a little bit and that's it for the most part. \n",
    "\n",
    "My personal philosophy for that is that we rarely ever need to use while loops. There are definetly scenarios where that is relevant and viable but for the most part when you're looping you have 2 conditions. You have knowledge of how many times you need to loop. You're unsure when your signal will come and looking for some trigger to happen. The first is where we can use a for loop. The second is where we'd be using a while loop. Most of the time we're probably going to fall into the first category.\n",
    "\n",
    "As I've said this is a personal philosophy. You can use while loops for everything in some way or another but you totally shouldn't. The reason that I say this is because you can get into trouble with infinite loops and memory leaks if something isn't closed properly. In a classroom setting this usually isn't that big of a deal/you'll hardly ever notice it. When we start to talk about running in a production, commercial, or enterprise environment we're not running things on a short spurt basis. Applications are running for days, months, possibly even years. Even a small leak over several months or years can be massively detrumental. \n",
