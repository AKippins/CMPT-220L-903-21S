    "## JavaDoc\n",
    "Coming off of a lab dealing with Markdown, discussing documentation seems like a good place to go next. Documentation is something that is super simple in concept but rather difficult to implement. At it's core documentation is simple. It's a set of instructions on how to use a product. When you really start to think about it though, it can quickly balloon into something rather complex. \n",
    "\n",
    "When thinking about documentation, is your audience:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Tech Savvy\n",
    "- Tech Illiterate\n",
    "- Younger\n",
    "- Older\n",
    "- Familiary With The Technology\n",
    "- A Developer Themselves\n",
    "- A Malicious User\n",
    "\n",
    "Thinking about all of these different scenarios you'd potentially write to them all in a different way. For someone that's Tech Savvy you may not need to give them as much detail because they may get the underlying theme of how your technology works and just need you to tell them how to implement it. \n",
    "\n",
    "For some one younger you may be able to use parallels to compare it to something they understand so that they get it, but that same example doesn't make any sense to someone older. \n",
    "\n",
    "We also need to alter our documentation for the medium that it's going to be consumed. As tech has gotten better we have the ability to make out lives easier by adding things like IntelliJ and VS Code into our arsenals. These both come with something called IntelliSense that can tell us what a function does before we commit to using it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now the way that it does this is through the proper documentation of code. In Java that's done by using Java Doc. Java Doc in the wholistic sense will write documentation and make a static webpage with that documentation based on the way that you comment your code. On the one hand people may think that documenting code is kind of tedious. On the other having a tool like Java Doc makes it very rewarding. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the purpose of this class we won't go to the full lengths there but we'll use the commenting style to add usage tips to our functions. As we talk through our lesson today. "
